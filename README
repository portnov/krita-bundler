USAGE

* Create a directory, say, ~/bundle.
* Put 'brushes' and 'paintoppresets' directories from old resource archive to that new directory.
* Put also preview.png file into the same directory.
* Chdir to ~/bundle.
* Run create-krita-bundle.py from console/terminal emulator.
* It will ask you several questions about the bundle being created.
* As a result, it will produce *.bundle file.
* Import that file to Krita to test that it works as expected.

The script can also read all answers from the config file specified as command line parameter,
for example
  create-krita-bundle.py test.bundleconfig

See example of config file in bundles/ramon.bundleconfig.

If PIL or Pillow module is available, then the script will check references from *.kpp files to
required brush files. It will print a warning for each not found brush.

There are also two utility scripts:

* `dump-kpp.py filename.kpp' just dumps XML description of preset from kpp file.
* `extract-external-links.py file1.kpp file2.kpp...' will print all references to other files from specified kpp files.
